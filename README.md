This is a simple library which reads data in from a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck on the Adafruit Trinket.

***NOTE***
Requires "TinyWireM", an I2C library which works on the Adafruit Trinket, because Wire does not.  TrinketNunchuck does not work without TinyWireM.


Good luck, and of course leave suggestions and questions for me to fix.
